# Applicability (A)

**Weight: 25%**

Applicability assesses the breadth of use cases a technology can effectively address, the health of its ecosystem, and the ease of integration with other tools and services. A high applicability score suggests a versatile and mature technology suitable for a wide range of production scenarios.

This metric is a weighted average of the following sub-components, each scored on a scale of 0.0 to 10.0.

## Sub-Metrics

### A1: Ecosystem & Package Diversity
-   **Description**: Measures the number and popularity of third-party libraries and packages that extend the core functionality for real-world use cases (e.g., authentication, data access, UI components).
-   **Data Sources**: Package manager APIs (npm, PyPI, Packagist) to analyze the quantity and download statistics of packages related to the technology.

### A2: Integration Friction Score
-   **Description**: Evaluates how smoothly the technology integrates with adjacent tools, platforms, and APIs in a typical development stack. High friction means more boilerplate code, workarounds, or undocumented steps are required.
-   **Data Sources**: Analysis of community forums, GitHub issues, and sample repositories to identify common integration pain points. Can be supplemented by expert surveys.

### A3: API Completeness & Documentation Quality
-   **Description**: Assesses how comprehensive and well-documented the technology's core APIs are. Gaps in the API may force developers to use low-level workarounds or third-party dependencies for common tasks.
-   **Data Sources**: Analysis of official API documentation, tracking the ratio of documented to undocumented functions/classes. Community feedback on documentation clarity and completeness.
