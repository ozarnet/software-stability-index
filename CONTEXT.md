## CONTEXT.md — Software Stability Index (SSI) Project

This repository defines the **Software Stability Index (SSI)** — a scientific, data-driven methodology and scoring system that evaluates the real-world **stability, applicability, and learnability** of programming languages, SDKs, frameworks, and development tools.

The goal of SSI is to:

- Help developers and engineering teams make **informed decisions** about technology adoption.
- Highlight the **hidden risks** of unstable or volatile ecosystems.
- Encourage maintainers to **track and improve their tools’ long-term reliability**.

This is not just a research exercise. It’s a practical framework designed to:

- Support CI integration (e.g., fail builds on risky dependency upgrades).
- Inform strategic choices (e.g., React vs. Vue vs. Laravel for a new product).
- Track and visualize risk in your current stack.

### Initial Implementation Scope

- Codify scoring criteria for:
  - Programming languages (e.g., Python, Swift, JavaScript)
  - SDKs and frameworks (e.g., React, Laravel, CodeIgniter, Flask)
  - Dev tools and IDEs (e.g., Xcode, JetBrains)
  - Backend + API stacks (REST, GraphQL)
- Provide a baseline JSON/CSV dataset with manually estimated SSI scores.
- Build scoring scripts and automation-ready pipelines.
- Eventually generate badges and visual graphs per stack.

This repo is **meant to evolve**. Collaboration welcome. Initial work is prototyping core logic, metrics definitions, scoring models, and automation concepts.

### Powered By

- Python (pandas, matplotlib, requests, PyGitHub, etc.)
- GitHub and package registry APIs
- Optional: Rust/Go-based CLI tooling
- GPT-4.1 / LLMs (as researcher-assistants, not oracles)

### Terminology

- **SSI**: A score from 0.0 to 10.0 that represents the overall health and usability of a toolchain entity.
- **Sub-metric**: A measurable aspect of a dimension (e.g., tutorial freshness is a sub-metric of Learnability).
- **Band**: Stability level category, such as Ultra-stable, Stable, Moderate, Low, Hazardous.

---

### Maintainer Notes

- This repo is not biased toward any stack.
- All scores and formulas must be **auditable, reproducible, and improvable**.
- Ideology: Don’t just ride trends. Quantify impact, reveal fragility, and promote informed decision-making.
